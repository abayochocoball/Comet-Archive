## What is included
Videos directly from youtube: [youtube_source.csv](youtube_source.csv)

Playlists retain their original names as the folder names. Other videos are grouped by content. The covers playlist is modified to place the duet between Suisei and Kanata, 19f2skdHhcE, as the 7th item, where it would have been if it was not made private. The 7th Hitman video and the recap video are also added to the playlist folder, the original playlist only had parts 1 to 6.

Videos from vikx (back up of youtube videos): [vikx_source.csv](vikx_source.csv)

## What is missing
See [known_missing.csv](known_missing.csv) + off channel collabs (some off channel collabs were included but not all)

## Incomplete archive.txt list
In 歌枠, the `archive.txt` file is missing the ids from files in the 歌枠\Extra folder. They are included in [youtube_source.csv](youtube_source.csv).
